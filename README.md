I used the 2019 part of the whole data. 

### Hypothesis: In which region the beverage sales are mostly intensitied? 
Finding: The sales of beverages mostly instensitied at Polk. The most revenue and count of sold bottles belong to Polk. We don’t have any idea about population. Maybe most of the region's population live in this county. 


### Hypothesis: Is there any difference between each month? 
Finding: 
By count of sold bottles, October 2019 comes to the forefront than other months. 

By total revenue, August 2019 comes to the forefront than other months. 


### Hypothesis: Is there any difference between each week days? 
Finding: The most revenue and  count of sold bottles belong to weekdays. People don't buy beverages at the weekend  and Tuesday has the most sales count on weekdays. 


### Hypothesis: Is there any difference between each category by months? 
Finding: People preferred the American Vodkas Category. The most revenue belongs to this category almost every month. People drank the most the American Vodkas in August 2019 in all months. 


### Hypothesis: Which category has the most revenue in 2019?  
Finding: People preferred the American Vodkas Category. The second most revenue belongs to Whiskey Liqueur. 


### Hypothesis: Does item’s price effective on total revenue? 
Finding: If we look at the most expensive items and their count of sold bottles, we can see their count of sold bottles are less than cheaper item’s. Their count of sold bottles is max 5-6 bottles in the year. On the other hand, The count of sold bottles of cheaper items is higher than expensive items. That case is normal. İtem’s price is effective on the count of sold bottles and the count of sold bottles is effective on total revenue. 


### Hypothesis: What are the best area’s choices?
Finding: The most revenue and count of sold bottles belong to Polk. Polk’s first choice is Whiskey Liqueur. That is different from total regions’ choices which is American vodkas category. The American vodkas category is the second choice of Polk. 


### Hypothesis: What can Iowa liquor’s vendors do for earning more revenue? 
Finding: 
Vendors can do campaigns on the weekend. Because they can sell their beverages on weekdays. 

Vendors can do campaigns in January, February and March. Because the least revenue and count of sold bottles belong to these months. 

Vendors can do advertisements for beverages which are cheaper but people don’t choose them.  In this way, people can see and buy others with advertisements. 

Vendors can do campaigns and advertisements at regions where they have lower sales counts.
